This repo contains **excerpts** of an iOS game. The game targeted iPhone OS 2.2 or 2.3 at its initial launch. (Wow, who remembers that term?) You'll see that the dates on the files are in 2009. So I wrote these classes some time ago. Rest assured that my style has matured over the years, in parallel with Objective-C. I do not guarantee that these files *would* compile in Xcode 7 given the full project source.

Yes, this code even predates ARC. Go retain/release! :)
